PhD Research: Radio source multipicity and Machine Learning.
Inprogress ~ Due for completion 2026
Developing tools to create true associations between seperated radio sources using morphological, spectral and flux analysis of the source to feed into a neural network to learn characteristics of these associations. This will allow for quick processing of SKA and future radio observational data.
